This is result from our M&M RSS simulation. There are 300 datasets, each with 1000 SNPs. 

For each dataset, we simulate signals using 2 type of priors:

1. Artificial mixture: 50 conditions.

   The detail about prior is [here](https://gaow.github.io/mvarbvs/analysis/20200402_create_prior_mixture.html#With-6-conditions).
   
   The oracle residual variance is a diagonal matrix.
   
2. GTEx mixture: 50 conditions.

   The detail about prior is [here](https://gaow.github.io/mvarbvs/analysis/20200402_create_prior_mixture.html#Mixture-from-GTEx).

   The oracle residual variance is a dense matrix.
   
We estimate prior weights using ‘EM’ method.

Overall: Ignoring correlation between conditions in residual matrix results in poor fit.
