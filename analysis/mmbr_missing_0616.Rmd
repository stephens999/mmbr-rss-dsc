This is result with missing values. There are 300 datasets, each with 300 SNPs. There are 6 conditions and we generate signals using artificial priors (details). We fit with oracle prior and residual variance. We estimate prior weights using ‘simple’ method (comparing with 0).

Overall: mvSuSiE with missing data has lower power than full data as we expected. RSS version has very high FDR, I need to further investigate what's happening.
